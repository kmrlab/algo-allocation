## üìã File Descriptions

### `allocation_by_efficiency.py`

**Advanced Multi-Method Portfolio Allocator**

A comprehensive portfolio allocation system that combines four different allocation methodologies:

- **Risk-Based**: Inverse risk weighting (1/drawdown)
- **Return-Weighted**: Proportional to expected returns
- **Efficiency-Based**: Return/risk ratio optimization
- **Market Cap Weighted**: Traditional market capitalization approach

**Key Features:**
- Configurable method weights (e.g., 25% risk, 25% return, 35% efficiency, 15% cap)
- Weight constraints (default: 4%-18% per asset)
- Comprehensive reporting with metrics
- Visual comparison of all methods
- Supports both crypto assets and trading strategies

**Use Case**: Ideal for balanced portfolio construction with customizable risk/return preferences.

### `allocation_cvar.py`

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) Optimization**

Professional risk management approach using CVaR optimization for trading strategy allocation:

- **CVaR Calculation**: 95% confidence level tail risk measurement
- **Constrained Optimization**: Minimum return targets with risk constraints
- **Strategy Analysis**: Performance metrics for 5 trading strategies
- **Weight Bounds**: 5%-40% allocation limits per strategy

**Key Features:**
- SLSQP optimization algorithm
- Annual return and volatility calculations
- Correlation analysis between strategies
- Professional visualization suite
- Export results for further analysis

**Use Case**: Perfect for institutional-grade risk management and regulatory compliance.

### `allocation_ivw.py`

**Inverse Volatility Weighting (IVW)**

Classic risk-parity approach that allocates capital inversely proportional to asset volatility:

- **Formula**: w·µ¢ = (1/œÉ·µ¢) / Œ£‚±º(1/œÉ‚±º)
- **Risk Focus**: Lower volatility = higher allocation
- **Performance Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, total return
- **5 Trading Strategies**: Trend, Mean-reversion, Pair-trading, Market-making, Arbitrage

**Key Features:**
- Automatic volatility calculation from historical returns
- Risk minimization objective
- Clear methodology explanation
- Professional dark-theme visualizations

**Use Case**: Conservative approach for risk-averse investors seeking stable returns.

### `allocation_performance_based.py`

**Multi-Factor Performance-Based Allocation**

Sophisticated allocation method combining multiple performance metrics:

- **Return Factor**: Total historical returns (50% weight)
- **Sharpe Factor**: Risk-adjusted returns (30% weight)  
- **Drawdown Factor**: Maximum drawdown protection (20% weight)
- **Normalization**: [0,1] scaling for fair comparison

**Key Features:**
- Configurable factor weights
- Normalized scoring system
- Combined performance score
- Handles negative drawdowns appropriately

**Use Case**: Performance-oriented allocation for growth-focused portfolios.

### `data.csv`

**Historical Strategy Performance Data**

Complete dataset containing daily returns for 5 trading strategies over 366 days:

- **Date Range**: January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024
- **Strategies**: Trend, Mean-reversion, Pair-Trading, Market-Making, Arbitrage
- **Format**: Clean CSV with proper date parsing
- **Data Quality**: No missing values, consistent formatting

**Statistics:**
- 366 trading days of data
- 5 different strategy types
- Daily return format (decimal percentages)
- Ready for immediate analysis

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Portfolio Allocation

```python
from allocation_by_efficiency import SimplePortfolioAllocator

# Your asset data
crypto_data = [
    {'name': 'BTC', 'return': 24.24, 'drawdown': 1.27, 'cap': 2090440108182},
    {'name': 'ETH', 'return': 42.03, 'drawdown': 16.72, 'cap': 290734266974},
    # ... more assets
]

# Create allocator
allocator = SimplePortfolioAllocator(
    data=crypto_data,
    min_weight=0.04,  # 4% minimum
    max_weight=0.18   # 18% maximum
)

# Define method weights
method_weights = {
    'risk_based': 0.25,
    'return_weighted': 0.25, 
    'efficiency': 0.35,
    'cap_weighted': 0.15
}

# Generate allocation and report
methods, final, constrained = allocator.calculate_final_allocation(method_weights)
report, results_table = allocator.generate_report(method_weights)
print(report)
```

### CVaR Optimization

```python
from allocation_cvar import main

# Run CVaR optimization with historical data
results = main()  # Automatically loads data.csv

# Results include:
# - Optimal strategy weights
# - Portfolio metrics (return, volatility, Sharpe ratio)
# - Risk measures (VaR, CVaR)
# - Visualization outputs
```

### Inverse Volatility Weighting

```python
from allocation_ivw import inverse_volatility_weighting

# Calculate IVW allocation
weights, allocations, metrics, volatilities = inverse_volatility_weighting(
    historical_returns=HISTORICAL_RETURNS, 
    total_capital=100000
)

# View results
print(f"Weights: {weights}")
print(f"Allocations: {allocations}")
```

## üéØ Supported Strategies

The algorithms support allocation across 5 different trading strategies:

1. **Trend Following**: Momentum-based directional trading
2. **Mean Reversion**: Statistical arbitrage and reversion strategies  
3. **Pair Trading**: Market-neutral relative value strategies
4. **Market Making**: Liquidity provision and spread capture
5. **Arbitrage**: Risk-free profit from price discrepancies

Each strategy has distinct risk-return characteristics suitable for portfolio diversification.

## üìä Mathematical Background

### Efficiency Calculation
```
Efficiency = Expected Return / Maximum Drawdown
```

### CVaR Formula
```
CVaR_Œ± = E[X | X ‚â§ VaR_Œ±]
where Œ± is the confidence level (typically 95%)
```

### Inverse Volatility Weighting
```
w_i = (1/œÉ_i) / Œ£_j(1/œÉ_j)
where œÉ_i is the volatility of asset i
```

### Performance Score
```
Score = 0.5 √ó Return_norm + 0.3 √ó Sharpe_norm + 0.2 √ó (-Drawdown_norm)
```

## üìà Visualization

- **Portfolio Allocation**: Pie charts and bar graphs
- **Risk-Return Scatter**: Strategy positioning analysis  
- **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side method comparison
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Inter-strategy relationships
